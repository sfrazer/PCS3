## Scene Ownership Rules

- **MainGame** is the application root and coordinator. It owns the layer structure, initializes systems, and handles scene transitions. It must not become a god object.
- **Level scenes** own geometry, TileMapLayers, backgrounds, environment settings, and spawn markers. Levels do NOT own the player.
- **Player** is instantiated by MainGame and added to the entity root. Level scenes expose spawn point markers; MainGame moves the player there.
- **Entity root** holds players, enemies, NPCs, pickups, and active objects — not embedded inside levels.
- **Effect root** holds temporary visual effects.
- UI layers (HUD, Pause, Transition, Debug) are separate CanvasLayers with explicit z-ordering. Leave gaps between layer values.

## Scene Tree Layer Order

| Layer         | Process Mode     |
|---------------|------------------|
| MainGame      | Always           |
| World         | Pausable         |
| HUD           | Pausable         |
| Pause         | When Paused      |
| Transition    | Always           |
| Debug         | Always           |

Set process modes intentionally — never rely on inherited defaults.

## Project Settings Checklist

Apply these before writing gameplay code:

- **Resolution:** Viewport 640×360 (or 320×180). Dev window override: 2000×1200.
- **Stretch:** Mode = `canvas_items`, Aspect = `keep`, Scale Mode = `integer`.
- **Physics layer names:** World, Player, Enemy, Interactable (under Layer Names → 2D Physics and 2D Render).
- **Input map:** Name actions by intent (`jump`, `interact`, `shoot`, `pause`) not by button. Map each to both keyboard and controller. Add `debug_quit` → Escape. Add `sprint` for dev use even if not in final design.
- **UI mouse filter:** Set full-screen Control nodes to `Mouse Filter = Ignore`. Set DebugTextOverlay `Behavior Recursive = Disabled`.
- **Version:** Use `major.minor.patch` (start at `0.1.0`) under Application → Config → Version.
- **Debug overlay:** Show FPS and version string from project settings at startup.
- **FPS cap:** Always set before shipping. Also set during editor development to avoid fan noise.

---

## GDScript Conventions

- **Always use static typing.** Declare variable types explicitly. Enable `untyped declaration = warn` under Project Settings → Debug → GDScript.
- **Script section order:** Follow Godot's recommended layout (signals, enums, constants, exports, vars, onready, built-in overrides, public functions, private functions). Define this once and stick to it.
- Use `@onready` variables for node references; drag-and-drop with Ctrl in the editor to auto-format.

---

## Key Rules (Things That Caused Real Problems)

### Never flip direction by negative X scale
Multiplying a node's X scale by -1 propagates to all children including Area2Ds, collision shapes, and raycasts. Visible collision shapes will look correct but physics interactions will be wrong.
- **Do:** Use `Sprite2D.flip_h` for visuals. Explicitly reposition or swap stored transforms for physics nodes.

### Use `offset` not `position` for sprite alignment
`position` is inherited by children (including spawn markers and collision shapes). `offset` only affects the texture.
- **Rule:** Position = game truth. Offset = art alignment.

### Be careful with `preload` in long-lived nodes
`preload` creates a persistent reference. If a node that never leaves the scene tree preloads a chain of scenes, those assets are never freed.
- **Do:** Keep preloads as close as possible to where they are used. A node that is removed should own its preloads so they are freed with it.

### Do not place enemies directly in level scenes
Enemies placed in the level process continuously regardless of player proximity.
- **Do:** Use a spawner with `VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D` so enemies only exist when relevant.

---

## Spawner System

Each spawner is a `Marker2D` with a `VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D` and a `Timer`.

**EnemyDefinition resource** (custom resource) holds:
- `PackedScene` — the enemy scene
- `Texture2D` — editor preview
- Default spawn conditions for that enemy type

The spawner references an `EnemyDefinition`, not the scene directly. This decouples the spawner from enemy internals and makes level setup data-driven.

**Spawner state (explicit):**
- Has active instance?
- Is instance on screen?
- Is cooldown running?
- Is this a one-time spawn already used?
- Has it re-entered the screen (for re-entry mode)?

**Spawn check pattern:** All events (screen enter/exit, enemy death, timer) call a single deferred `_check_spawn()`. One function answers: am I blocked right now? If not, spawn.

**Instantiation:** Goes through a spawn manager that adds enemies to the entity root — not inside the level. This keeps the scene tree inspectable during debug.

**Respawn modes (examples):**
- One-time only
- Respawn after leaving and re-entering screen
- Respawn on timer with random delay
- Respawn immediately when visible and available

---

## Level Loading

All scene transitions go through a single `load_level()` function in MainGame. Callers never need to know the implementation details. The function:
1. Defers the change to idle frame
2. Frees the current level if one exists
3. Waits a frame for cleanup
4. Loads and instantiates the new scene, cast as `BaseLevel` (safety check)
5. Places the player at the level's spawn marker
6. Connects the camera

---

## Debug Tools

- **God mode:** Separate player state with fast movement, no gravity, hurtbox disabled. Dev only — do not ship.
- **Global time scale:** Use for debugging or slow-motion effects.
- **Alt + right-click** in editor: select specific overlapping nodes (requires select mode).
- **Favorite scenes:** Right-click in FileSystem to mark frequently used scenes.
- **Color folders/files:** Useful for navigating large projects.
- **MSDF fonts:** Enable under Project Settings → GUI → Theme → Font if fonts look blurry.

---

## Version Control

Use Git. Commit the moment a feature works. Compare against last known good state when something breaks after cleanup. Enables confident refactoring.

---

## Unit Testing (GUT)

This project uses [GUT (Godot Unit Test)](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) for automated testing.

### What to Test

Any logic that can be tested in isolation should have a corresponding test. This includes:
- Spawner state and spawn condition checks
- EnemyDefinition resource validation
- Player state transitions
- Input handling logic
- Level loading and scene casting safety checks
- Any utility or data processing functions

UI layout, shader behavior, and physics interactions are out of scope for unit tests.

### Test Location

Place tests under `source/debug/tests/` mirroring the structure of the source they cover.
For example, a test for `source/gameplay/spawner.gd` lives at `source/debug/tests/test_spawner.gd`.

### Writing Tests

- Every test script must extend `GutTest`.
- Test methods must be prefixed with `test_`.
- Use `assert_eq`, `assert_true`, `assert_null` etc. rather than raw `assert`.
- Each test should cover one behavior. Prefer many small tests over fewer broad ones.
- Use `before_each` to reset state between tests rather than relying on test order.

### Running Tests (Headless)

The project must be imported before the first headless run. Import once with:

```sh
godot --headless --import
```

Then run the full suite with:

```sh
godot --headless -s res://addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd
```

**Important:** use `gut_cmdln.gd`, not `gut_cli.gd`. `gut_cli.gd` extends `Node` and cannot be used with `-s`; `gut_cmdln.gd` extends `SceneTree` and works correctly. GUT reads `.gutconfig.json` at the project root and exits non-zero if any tests fail.

### When to Run Tests

- Run the full test suite before opening a pull request. All tests must pass.
- Run relevant tests after any change to a system that has test coverage.
- A failing test is a blocker — do not open a PR with known failures.

### Known GUT Gotchas

- **`push_error` in tests causes failure.** GUT treats any `push_error` call during a test frame as an unexpected error, failing the test even if all assertions pass. Do not write tests that exercise code paths that call `push_error`.
- **JSON type mismatch on deserialize.** `JSON.parse_string()` returns an untyped `Array`; you cannot assign it directly to `Array[Dictionary]`. Iterate and append each element explicitly instead of using `.duplicate()`.
- **Empty string passed to `JSON.parse_string()`** triggers an engine-level error that GUT flags as unexpected. Guard with `if json_string.is_empty(): return false` before calling the parser.

---

## Visual Verification (Screenshot)

For tasks that require visual confirmation that a scene renders correctly, use the helper script:

```sh
source/debug/tests/godot_screenshot.sh [scene_path] [output_png]
```

- `scene_path` — optional `res://` path to run as the main scene for this run. The script temporarily swaps `project.godot` and restores it on exit.
- `output_png` — where to save the result (default: `/tmp/godot_screenshot.png`).

The script launches Godot at 1280×768, activates the window, captures it, and exits non-zero if any `SCRIPT ERROR` or `ERROR` lines appear in the log. Arguments can appear in any order.

**Examples:**

```sh
# Run the current main scene (error check only, no Preview)
source/debug/tests/godot_screenshot.sh

# Run a specific scene, save to a named file
source/debug/tests/godot_screenshot.sh res://source/gameplay/construction/construction_scene.tscn /tmp/task5.png

# Open the result in Preview for visual inspection
source/debug/tests/godot_screenshot.sh --preview res://source/gameplay/construction/construction_scene.tscn /tmp/task5.png
```
