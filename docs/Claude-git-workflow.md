# claude-git.md — Git Workflow Guidelines

---

## Branch Strategy

- Always create a new branch before starting work on a feature or system.
- Branch naming: use descriptive kebab-case names reflecting the feature (`spawner-system`, `player-combat`, `ui-pause-menu`).
- Never commit directly to `main`.
- Merge back to `main` via pull request with squash merge to keep history clean.
- After merging, pull `main` locally before starting the next branch.

---

## Commit Timing

Commit when:
- Something works that didn't before
- You're about to attempt something experimental
- End of a working session (work-in-progress commits on a branch are fine)

Do not wait until a large feature is complete. Small, frequent commits on a branch are preferable to one large commit.

---

## What Not to Commit

The `.gitignore` should exclude:
- Exported builds
- Editor configuration folders
- Local backup directories

The `.gitattributes` should route binary assets through Git LFS:
- `.png`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, and any other binary asset formats used in the project

Do not stage or commit files that match these exclusions. If in doubt, check `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` at the repo root before staging.

## Pre-PR Checklist

Before opening any pull request, run the following steps in order:

1. Run the full GUT test suite. All tests must pass.
2. Run the Ollama code review. This review is expensive and time consuming. If you run it in the background, do not use "head" as a test that it's working. Create a docs/codereviews directory and save the full output of the commend there with a descriptive name and use that to address any findings:

```bash
ollama launch pi --model glm-5.2:cloud -- -p "review this code and return your findings"
```

3. Address any findings from the review.
4. Only open the PR once both steps pass cleanly.

## Godot-Specific Note

When adding Git to an existing Godot project, Version Control Metadata must be initialized via `Project → Version Control → Create/Override Version Control Metadata` with Git selected. This only needs to be done once.
